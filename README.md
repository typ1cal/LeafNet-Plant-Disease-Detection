## 📜 Project Overview

**LeafNet** is a cutting-edge machine learning project designed to detect plant leaf types and identify diseases from leaf images. Leveraging powerful deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, LeafNet helps in promoting early diagnosis of plant diseases, ultimately aiding in healthier crop yields and better agricultural outcomes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-class Leaf Disease Classification**: Detects and classifies multiple plant diseases based on leaf images.
- **Healthy vs. Diseased Identification**: Determines if a plant is healthy or diseased.
- **Supports Multiple Crops**: Includes leaves from crops like Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, and Tomato.
- **Real-time Inference with GPU**: Optimized for fast predictions using GPU.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of plant leaves categorized by different diseases, including but not limited to:

- Apple Scab
- Black Rot (Apple)
- Northern Leaf Blight (Corn)
- Early Blight (Potato)
- Bacterial Spot (Tomato)

The dataset also includes healthy leaves for each plant type.

## 🖼️ Example Predictions

Check out some example outputs of LeafNet in action:

| Plant Leaf       | Predicted Disease          |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Apple Leaf       | Apple Scab                 |
| Tomato Leaf      | Septoria Leaf Spot         |
| Potato Leaf      | Early Blight               |
| Corn Leaf        | Northern Leaf Blight       |
